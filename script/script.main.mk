### DESCRIPTION

# This module handles the configuration and installation of
# scripts.  The target language is the Bourne shell but other
# scripting languages are supported as well.


# Scripts and Libraries:
#
# We consider two groups of files: script programs (SCRIPT) and script
# libraries (SCRIPTLIB).


# Configuration:
#
# We support configuration of scripts by allowing replacement
# of some fixed strings in the file.  This completes the similar
# feature of `autoconf`.  This replacement is only performed in
# script programs and not in script libraries.


# Variables:
#
#  PROGRAM
#   List of script programs to install
#
#   If a file in this list has a name ending in one of the
#   suffixes enumerated in _SCRIPT_SUFFIXES, then variable replacement
#   may occur in this file, and the file is always installed under a
#   name without the suffix.
#
#
#  SUBR
#   List of script subroutine libraries to install
#
#
#  SUBRDIR [${SHAREDIR}${PACKAGEDIR}]
#   List of script libraries to install
#
#   The variables SUBRDIR, SUBRMODE, SUBROWN and
#   SUBRGRP parametrise the installation.
#
#   The SUBRDIR variable defaults to
#   `${SHAREDIR}${PACKAGEDIR}` but other sensible locations could
#   be `${LIBDIR}/perl5/5.12.4${PACKAGEDIR}`.
#
#
#  REPLACE [not set]
#   List of variables to be replaced in the preparation step
#
#   The pipe character `|` must not appear in replacement text of the
#   variables enumerated by REPLACE.
#
#  STDREPLACE [see description]
#   The standard replacement list
