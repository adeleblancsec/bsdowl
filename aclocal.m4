# case of Solaris' /usr/bin/id which is the first found on the path in some
# configurations.
#
# If a suitable program is found, it can be used through the content
# of the ID program.  If no such a program is found, the value of this
# variable is `no`.

# AC_PROG_BSDMAKE
# ---------------
# Check for a BSD Make program which is compatible with a recent
# version of BSD Make (2014-02-14 or later).
#
# - On FreeBSD 10.0 or newer, it will use `make' from the base system.
# - On NetBSD 6.1.5 or newer, it will use `make' from the base system.
# - On other platforms, it will look for a `bmake' program.
#
# If a suitable program is found, its name is affected to the BSDMAKE
# variable.  If no such a program has been found, this variable is set
# to `no'.
#
# Note that OpenBSD is not supported as there is modern no version of
# bmake available wether in the base system nor in the ports at time
# of writing (OpenBSD 5.6).
#
# This macro will break for NetBSD 10.X, many years from now.
