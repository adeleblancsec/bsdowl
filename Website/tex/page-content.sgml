<h1>Foreword: working with TeX or LaTeX</h1>

<p>There is multiple TeX formats in use, plain TeX and LaTeX are
examples of such formats.  The LaTeX format enjoys a wide community of
users, so the module latex.doc.mk is used in examples. However most of
the following applies to the module tex.doc.mk as
well. Some paragraphs in the sequel document mechanisms specific to
latex.doc.mk, they are explicitly identified as such.</p>


<h1>Simple use</h1>

<p>The preparation of a simple document with LaTeX itself is very
easy, thus the use of BPS may at a first glance look like a useless
complication instead of a simplification. It provides some
useful features, however.</p>


<h2>The first time</h2>

<p>Assume the file script.tex holds your
manuscript. Put it in a directory dedicated to your document, and
create a Makefile file (note the leading capital) with the following
content:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = script.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>Your document's directory now contains the paper.tex file and the
Makefile described above.  Point your shell's working directory to
your document's directory, and issue the <em>make</em> command:</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ make
make build
===> Multipass job for script.dvi (aux)
latex script.tex
This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)
entering extended mode
(./script.tex
LaTeX2e <2003/12/01>
...
</pre>

<p>If your manuscript has no error, you end up with the following
object files in your working directory:</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ ls
Makefile    script.log
script.aux  script.tex
script.dvi  script.toc
</pre>

<p>Once you are done with the objects, you can clean the directory
with the <em>make clean</em> mantra:</p>

<pre class="shell">
$ make clean
rm -f  script.dvi script.log script.aux script.toc
</pre>

<p>Cleaning the directory is an optional step, but it prevents your storage and
your archive media to end up filled with unused data, that can be
quickly recreated on demand. While DVI files are usually very small,
a few hundred kilobytes, the PS or PDF objects are often much
larger.</p>


<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>Before you clean up your working directory with the <em>make
clean</em> mantra, you may wish to store the objects you created
in some adequate place of the local filesystem.  This step is called
<em>installation</em> of your document, because it is analogous to the
installation of a program you freshly compiled.  You require the
installation of your document with the <em>make install</em> command,
but you must first tell make which place is
actually adequate. This is done by assigning the DOCUMENTDIR variable with the
path to the directory you want your files to be copied to, as displayed by
the following Makefile:</p>
<pre class="file">
DOCUMENTDIR = ${HOME}/doc/report
DOC = script.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>You can then proceed with the <em>make install</em> command:</p>
<pre class="shell">
$ make install
install -d /home/michi/doc/report
install -o michi -g michi -m 440 script.dvi /home/michi/doc/report
</pre>

<p>In comparison with the manual approach for storing the object in a
safe place with the <em>cp</em> command, you save retyping the target
directory name the next time you update your document. Moreover, it eases
the organization of your document sources library and scales to a
large number of documents, see <em>Working with a large number of
documents</em> below.</p>


<h2>Selecting an output format</h2>

<p>The TeX toolchain is capable of producing electronic documents in
several formats. Commonly used formats are DVI, PostScript (PS) and
PDF. The TEXDEVICE variable governs the format of documents produced
with the help of latex.doc.mk. Its value is usually <em>dvi</em>, so
that latex.doc.mk will produce a DVI file from your source.  Other
possible values are <em>ps</em> or <em>pdf</em>.  If you configured a
PostScript printer <em>TEXPRINTER</em> with the texconfig program, you
also can use <em>ps.TEXPRINTER</em> as a value in TEXDEVICE, it will
instruct dvips to use the settings for TEXPRINTER when translating
your DVI file to PostScript. It is also possible to list several
output formats in TEXDEVICE, like <em>dvi pdf ps.TEXPRINTER1 ps.TEXPRINTER2</em>.</p>


<h2>Drafts and multipass jobs</h2>

<p>Some formats or macros need your manuscript to be processed several
times by TeX or LaTeX before you obtain the final version of your
document.  The latex.tex.mk module enforces multipass treatment of your manuscript,
because LaTeX needs this to produce correct cross references created
with <em>label</em> and <em>ref</em> commands within your document.
The doc.tex.mk module will not do multiple treatment of your
manuscript unless you set the variable MULTIPASS to a list of name,
each element giving its name to a pass.  The choice of these names does
not have a real importance, as they are only displayed to the user.
It is even possible to specify the same name several times!</p>

<p>In the early stages of existence of a document, updates are likely to be
frequent and it is thus desirable to avoid the lenghty multiple passes
processing.  BPS has a draft mode for this. To
enable the draft mode, set make's variable DRAFT to yes, this is done
by adding an appropriate statement in the Makefile, as shown by the
following example:

<pre class="file">
DRAFT?= yes
DOC = script.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>The statement <em>DRAFT?=</em> is a special form of an assignement
statement, that allows you to type <em>make DRAFT=no</em> at the shell
prompt if you want to re-enable multipass processing of your job for
one time.
When you have finished polishing your manuscript, you can remove
the DRAFT assignement from the Makefile, your paper is then ready for a last <em>make</em>
run producing the final version of your document.  If you are
satisfied with it, you can <em>install</em> it.</p>

<p>When working on a document, it might be useful to keep copies of the
objects you produced at some point of your work.  For instance,
picture yourself sending a copy of your work to a friend.  Your friend
will read your paper with attention and send you back his comments,
but in meanwhile, you kept on improving your document.  When you
receive the comments of your friend, you will compare them to the
document you sent him.  It is therefore useful to keep a copy of it.
The best way to do this is probably to use a RCS, a software system
managing history of files.  If you do not use such a system,
BPS might be here of some help.</p>

<p>When the variable DRAFT is set to <em>yes</em> and the variable
TEXDRAFTSTAMP is not initialised, it receives the value
-${TEXDRAFTTIMESTAMP} where TEXDRAFTTIMESTAMP expands to the date when
Make is run.  When the variable TEXDRAFTSTAMP is initalised and not
empty, its value is appended to the name of all document installed by
latex.doc.mk or latex.doc.mk. If you do not want the name of the files
to be modified, you just need to initialise TEXDRAFTSTAMP with an
empty value.</p>


<h2>Split document</h2>

<p>If you are working on a complex document, you certainly have split
your sources into several files. Usually one file per chapter, or per
section, plus a main file containing the preamble and many
<em>input</em> statements to instruct LaTeX to read all of the files
actually containing the document.</p>

<p>Assume that your document is split into a main file galley.tex
and two other files part1.tex and part2.tex. Your galley.tex
certainly looks like this:</p>

<pre class="file">
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
\input{part1}
\input{part2}
\end{document}
</pre>

<p>A suitable Makefile is then:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = galley.tex
SRCS = part1.tex
SRCS+= part2.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>


<h1>More advanced features</h1>

<h2>Figures with METAPOST</h2>

<p>Modules latex.doc.mk and tex.doc.mk comes with a nice support for
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/hobby/MetaPost.html">METAPOST</a>
generated pictures, provided you have <a
href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">Ghostscript</a> and a working
TeX installation. This is something worth noting, since METAPOST is
often the right tool to be used for drawing figures appearing in TeX
documents, but support for it is missing in many GUI editors for LaTeX.</p>

<p>Assume you prepared illustrations for your article with METAPOST,
and split your illustrations into two files illustr1.mp and
illustr2.mp. To let latex.doc.mk handle the production of your
figures, add FIGS statements to your Makefile:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = galley.tex
SRCS = part1.tex
SRCS+= part2.tex
FIGS = illustr1.mp
FIGS+= illustr2.mp
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>Then type in <i>make</i> at the shell prompt. The latex.doc.mk will
then figure out how many illustrations are present in each file, and
produce the image files required by your TEXDEVICE.</p>

<p><i>Discovering METAPOST.</i>
If you do not know about METAPOST but are interested in discovering it, the
first good news is that this program is included by many (if not all)
TeX distributions. The second good news is that you can easily find
plenty of information and examples of its use on the WWW. For instance
the <a href="http://www.tug.org/metapost.html">TeX users group</a> has
a page on its website devoted to this tool. The list you will find
there is pretty long, so let me add that I especially like the
introduction written by <a
href="http://remote.science.uva.nl/~heck/Courses/mptut.pdf">Andr√©
Heck</a>, it might also be a good starting point for you.</p>



<h2>Bibliography</h2>

<p>BPS supports the preparation of bibliographies with BibTeX. First,
you must be sure that the program TeX will find the bibliographic
databases you enumerated in your document with <em>bibliography</em>
statements.  It is customary to gather bibliographic databases in some
directory, for instance <em>${HOME}/share/bin</em>.  To let bibtex
find these files, it is enough to add ${HOME}/share/bin to the content
of the variable BIBINPUTS.  If your bibliographic databases are
scattered among several directories, you just need to let each of them
appear in the value of the variable BIBINPUTS:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = galley.tex
SRCS = part1.tex
SRCS+= part2.tex
BIBINPUTS = ${HOME}/share/bib
BIBINPUTS+= ../morebib
.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>

<p>Note that the <em>make clean</em> mantra will leave intact the BBL
file produced by bibtex.  This is because you sometimes need to send
this file to your publisher instead of a bibtex database.  Hence the
<em>make clean</em> or <em>make distclean</em> will leave you
document's directory in the state you want to have it when you want to
redistribute it. To get rid of the BBL file as well, you need to use
the more powerful mantra <em>make realclean</em>.</p>


<h2>Index</h2>

<p>At that time, there is no specific provision in BPS to
help the preparation of LaTeX documents featuring an index.  You are
on your own.</p>


<h2>Several documents in the same directory</h2>

<p>While it is often a good idea to reserve a directory for each of
your documents, you might have some reasons to keep several documents
in the same directory.  You have your reasons and they are probably
good ones, so BPS will do its best ot help you.</p>

<p>We assume that you have two documents whose sources are
living in the same directory, let's say an article and an abridged version
of this article. These files share a macro file macro.tex, but are
otherwise rather independent (from LaTeX's point of view). The text of
the article is split across two files,
section1.tex and section2.tex. The summary has just one text file
summary.tex. The Makefile used looks like this:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = article.tex
DOC+= summary.tex

SRCS = macros.tex

SRCS.article.tex = section1.tex
SRCS.article.tex+= section2.tex

.include "latex.doc.mk"
</pre>


<h2>Recalculating part of a document</h2>

<p>Assume you are working on a document containing a table whose
content is likely to change several times and will need to be
updated.  Such a table coule be a budget:  when information on the
situation evolves, so does the budget.  It can be quite tedious to
type in a table in LaTeX, and updating it might even be trickier.  In
such a situation, it is probably a good idea to write a program
reading the raw data of your table and writing a LaTeX table
displaying your data and everything you want to compute from it.  Such
a program is usually very easy to write, because you only need to deal
with text files all of the time.</p>

<p>So you have gathered the raw data of your table in the file
table.raw and written a small program gentable that will write for you
a LaTeX table on its standard output.  In your manuscript, you use the
name <em>table</em> to refer to the file containing the generated
table. Here is your Makefile:</p>

<pre class="file">
DOC = galley.tex
.include "latex.doc.mk"

table.tex: gentable table.raw
	./gentable < table.raw > table.tex

REALCLEANFILES+= table.tex
</pre>

<p>If you send your files to someone else, he will maybe not want to
run your program gentable, so it is better to list table.tex in
REALCLEANFILES than in CLEANFILES.</p>

<p>Of course, you can compute some text or a METAPOST picture, or
whatever, instead of a table!</p>

<h2>Organizing long documents</h2>
