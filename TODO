TODO -- Hey Emacs, it's an -*- Org -*- mode file!

* RELEASE ENGINEERING
** Dependencies and suggestions
*** mktexlsr
Remove the install time dependance to `mktexlsr' used by
`noweb/nwlatex.tex'.
*** TeX/LaTeX
List TeX/LaTeX as a suggested package, for `noweb'.
*** OpenSP
List OpenSP as a suggested package, for `onsgmls', the SGML normalizer
used to prepare WEB pages.
*** nwlatex.css
Fix installation path for `nwlatex.css'.
** Installation
*** FILESGRP
Do not use the wheel group in some systems (Debian) that do not have
one.

* MODULES
** OCaml
The functionalities of these modules shall be reworked.  They lack
support for many capabilities of the compiler.  Support for OBJDIR
should also provide the opportunity to compile against different
interfaces (with ocamlfind's predicate capability).

** NOWEB
The functionnalities of these modules shall be a bit cleaned up.  A
notable point is the production of a LaTeX file (by weaving) that is
part of a larger document.  We also want to improve the usability of
NOWEB by other modules.

* DOCUMENTATION
** Comments in files
The comments in many files must be edited until they reach a
satisfactory state.  We pursue the following goals:

 eng	The comments shall all be in english, but in some places some
 	french sentences persist.

 str	The comments shall all be structured the same way.

Here is a list of files and their state with respect to the
achievement of these two goals.

** Website
Documentation on the web site shall be improved and enlarged.  The
focus must go on working examples.  Here is a list of pages that shall
be written or worked on.

*** TeX and LaTeX documents
We need a text illustrating:
  * the preparation of a simple document;
  * the preparation of a document whose files are dispatched across
    several directories;
  * the preparation of a document with some input files generated by a
    script;
  * the preparation of a document with figures;
  * the preparation of a document with a bibliography.

*** SGML based websites
We need a text illustrating:
  * the preparation of a simple document;
  * the preparation of a document whose files are dispatched across
    several directories;
  * the preparation of a document with some input files generated by a
    script.

*** NOWEB based LaTeX macros
We need a text illustrating:
  * the preparation of a simple macro files;
  * the generation of a HTML version of the documentation.

*** NOWEB base Maple macros
