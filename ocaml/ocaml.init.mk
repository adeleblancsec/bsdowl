### SYNOPSIS

# .include "ocaml.init.mk"


### DESCRIPTION

# This modules is responsible for early initialisation of some
# variables used by our OCaml framework. It defines _OCAML_OBJECT and
# reads in several modules.
#
# This module is intended to be included by other modules rather than
# to serve as is to the end user.

# Variables:
#
#
#  _OCAML_OBJECT
#   The list of object groups handled by our framework
#
#
#  LIBDIR
#   The installation target for libraries
#
#   The value defined in `bps.own.mk` is suited for C libraries but not
#   for OCaml objects that are rather installed in the same location as
#   the standard library.
#
#   It takes into account the PACKAGEDIR variable.


### IMPLEMENTATION

.if !target(__<ocaml.init.mk>__)
__<ocaml.init.mk>__:

.if !defined(PACKAGEDIR)||empty(PACKAGEDIR)
LIBDIR?=${libdir}/ocaml${PACKAGEDIR}
.else
LIBDIR?=${libdir}/ocaml/site-lib${PACKAGEDIR}
.endif
